# 📊 Google Play Store Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an **end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Google Play Store dataset to uncover insights about app categories, ratings, installs, pricing, and user preferences. The goal is to understand market trends and factors that influence app performance using real-world data.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw Google Play Store data
- Analyze app distribution across categories and content ratings
- Explore relationships between installs, ratings, price, and app type
- Compare **Free vs Paid** apps
- Visualize insights using Python plotting libraries

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Information
- **Source:** Google Play Store dataset (Kaggle / public dataset)
- **Records:** Apps with ratings, reviews, installs, price, category, and more
- **Data Type:** Real-world, messy dataset (missing values & inconsistencies)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – analysis environment

---

## 🔍 Key Steps Performed
### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Removed or imputed missing values
- Converted data types (Installs, Price, Reviews)
- Handled inconsistent and duplicate entries

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis
- Category-wise app distribution
- Rating distribution analysis
- Installs vs Rating relationship
- Free vs Paid app comparison
- Price distribution analysis

### 3️⃣ Data Visualization
- Count plots for categories and content ratings
- Box plots for ratings and installs
- Histograms & KDE plots for price and ratings
- Pie charts for category popularity

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Free apps dominate the Play Store ecosystem
- Certain categories receive significantly higher installs
- Higher installs do not always guarantee higher ratings
- Paid apps tend to have slightly better average ratings
- Most apps are priced very low or are free
